## PRE-REQ
Students should have completed at least one semester of computer programming (Arduino, Creative Coding, GOA Computer Science, etc.). Alternatively, students may demonstrate prior programming experience by taking a multiple choice test.

## OBJECTIVE
AP Computer Science A (Java) is an advanced Java programming class. Topics covered include the Java programming language, Object Oriented Programming, inheritance, Git and GitHub, searching and sorting, recursion and good programming style.

This course covers all APCS A topics and is equivalent to a typical first semester college computer science course.

## MATERIALS
All course materials and assignments are available online: [https://github.com/Isidore-Newman-School/AP-CS-A](https://github.com/Isidore-Newman-School/AP-CS-A).

The textbook for the course is the free online interactive version of Think Java by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield: [https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/](https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/).
